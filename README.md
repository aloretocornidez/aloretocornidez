My goal has, and always will be to achieve excellence in every action I take. If I am not immediately good at something, I will practice until I am. My determination has met no bound, and I never intend to let it do so.

I have overcome many hardships in my schooling career. For example, I was about to drop out my first semester. I failed a class and was going to lose my scholarship. At that moment I recognized that every action I take will shape my habits for the rest of my life. With that in mind, I decided to take a risk and continue with my schooling in Electrical and Computer engineering. Me 'puse las pilas' and now I am in my senior year and will be proudly finishing my coursework and graduating with a BS in May 2023. 

I seek to challenge myself in everything I do and I like to surround myself with others who do the same.

Currently I seek a Master's degree via the accelerated master's program at the UofA, if I fond a job that I enjoy I will go into industry immediately after I graduate my bachelor program.
